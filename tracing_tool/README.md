The ***tracer_tool*** is used to extract the memory and SASS traces. This repo use and extend NVBit (NVidia Binary Instrumentation Tool) which is a research prototype of a dynamic binary instrumentation library for NVIDIA GPUs. Licence and agreement of NVBIT is found in the origianal [NVBIT repo](https://github.com/NVlabs/NVBit) (“This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation”)

NVBIT does not require application source code, any pre-compiled GPU application should work regardless of which compiler (or version) has been used (i.e. nvcc, pgicc, etc).

## Usage

* Please see our docker [wiki](https://github.com/NMSU-PEARL/PPT-GPU/wiki/Docker-Images-and-Usage) page for how to build the teacing tool and extract the traces using docker.

* For stanalone buklding  and running of the tracing_tool (no docker), please see below: 

## Building the tool
  
  * Setup **ARCH** variable in the Makefile
  * run make clean; make

## Extracting the traces
  
  ```
  LD_PRELOAD=~/PPT-GPU/tracing_tool/tracer.so ./app.out
  ```
  
The above command outputs two folders ***memory_traces*** and ***sass_traces*** each has the applications kernel traces. Setup the **MAX_KERNELS** variable in ***tracer.cu*** to define the limit on the number of kernels you want to instrument in the application
